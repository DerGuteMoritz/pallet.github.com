> In late 2011 we started an effort to put Pallet's documentation up

### I don't have much time, how can I help?

The easiest way to help is by reporting an issue in our issue tracker. 

To do this,
[click here to create a new issue](https://github.com/pallet/pallet.github.com/issues/new)
in our documentation issue tracker. 

Please provide a concise title e.g. _"The AWS example in
/doc/example/create-node doesn't work with Pallet 0.6.5"_, and add as
much information in the description as possible, especially the page
or pages affected and if you have the time, a possible solution or
indication of how the solution would look like.

If possible, select the tag to the right of the page to indicate the
type of error (error, missing, unclear, etc.) and the area of the
website where it is (documentation, reference, api, etc.)

### Really, I don't have the time :(

Send a tweet to @palletops then!

### I can't stand broken documentation! I feel an urge to right this wrong.
    
Ah then! Thank you!
