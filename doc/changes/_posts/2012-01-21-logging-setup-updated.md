title: Logging section updated for SLF4J
section: documentation

We have updated the
[Logging](http://palletops.com/doc/reference/logging/) section in the
[Reference Documentation](http://palletops.com/doc/reference/logging)
to reflect the fact that Pallet has its logging subsystem from using
[log4j](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/) to using
[SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/). This move allows the configuration of
many different logging subsystems. By default, the logging library
used is now [logback](http://http://logback.qos.ch/).
